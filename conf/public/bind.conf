#  If you want to link servers to InspIRCd you must load the          #
#  m_spanningtree.so module! Please see the modules list below for    #
#  information on how to load this module! If you do not load this    #
#  module, server ports will NOT be bound!                            #

# PLEASE NOTE: If you have build InspIRCd with IPv6 support, you MUST #
# specify a bind address if you want the IRCd to bind to a IPv4 IP.   #

      # you can select multiple ports by separating them

# When linking servers, the openssl and gnutls transports are largely
# link-compatible and can be used alongside each other
# on each end of the link without any significant issues.
# Transports can only be used on server blocks.
# Supported Transports are: "zip", "openssl" and "gnutls".
# You must load m_ziplinks module for zip, m_ssl_openssl for openssl
# or m_ssl_gnutls for gnutls.
