#   This is where you can configure which connections are allowed     #
#   and denied access onto your server. The password is optional.     #
#   You may have as many of these as you require. To allow/deny all   #
#   connections, use a '*' or 0.0.0.0/0.                              #
#                                                                     #
#  -- It is important to note that connect tags are read from the  -- #
#     TOP DOWN. This means that you should have more specific deny    #
#    and allow tags at the top, progressively more general, followed  #
#        by a <connect allow="*" (should you wish to have one).       #
#                                                                     #
