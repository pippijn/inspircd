#   Opers are defined here. This is a very important section.         #
#   Remember to only make operators out of trust worthy people.       #

# oline with plain-text password

      # name: oper login that is used to oper up (/oper name password).
      # Remember: This is case sensitive

      # password: case-sensitive, unhashed...yea...self-explanatory.
      password=""

      # host: What hostnames/IP's are allowed to oper up with this oline.
      # Multiple options can be separated by spaces and CIDR's are allowed.
      # You CAN use just * or *@* for this section, but it is not recommended
      # for security reasons.
      host="*@*"

      # ** ADVANCED ** This option is disabled by default.
      # fingerprint: When using the m_sslinfo module, you may specify
      # a key fingerprint here. This can be obtained by using the /sslinfo
      # command while the module is loaded, and is also noticed on connect.
      # This enhances security by verifying that the person opering up has
      # a matching SSL client certificate, which is very difficult to
      # forge (impossible unless preimage attacks on the hash exist).
      # If m_sslinfo isn't loaded, this option will be ignored.

      # autologin: if an SSL fingerprint for this oper is specified, you can
      # have the oper block automatically log in. This moves all security of the
      # oper block to the protection of the client certificate, so be sure that
      # the private key is well-protected! Requires m_sslinfo.
      autologin="yes"

      # sslonly: This oper can only oper up if they're using a SSL connection.
      # Setting this option adds a decent bit of security. Highly recommended
      # if the oper is on wifi, or specifically, unsecured wifi. Note that it
      # is redundant to specify this option if you specify a fingerprint.
      # This setting only takes effect if m_sslinfo is loaded.
      sslonly="yes"

      # vhost: overrides the vhost in the type block. Class and modes may also
      # be overridden

      # type: What oper type this oline is. See the block above for list
      # of types. NOTE: This is case-sensitive as well.
