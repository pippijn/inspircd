# CIDR configuration allows detection of clones and applying of       #
# throttle limits across a CIDR range. (A CIDR range is a group of    #
# IPs, for example, the CIDR range 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255 may be   #
# represented as 192.168.1.0/24). This means that abuse across an ISP #
# is detected and curtailed much easier.                              #
